Android Mobile App capable of displaying data in visual forms.This app also has 'google map integration' and 'email client integration' feature

This is the code for a mobile app which is capable of showing fata in visual forms. I have used 'MPAndroidChart' library to render the charts on the mobile screen. You can swipe screens left or right to reach to the next screen.

Also, this app has 'google map integration' and 'email client integration' feature.

This app has been coded in Java on Android Studio.

The documentation with the screen shots is in the report 'Mobile_App_Android_Report.docx'
